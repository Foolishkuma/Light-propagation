# Light-propagation
Light behavior with refraction and reflection

When variables such as x, y, z, t, wave length, etc. are given, 
Light class hold them and offer methods 
to calculate electrical field vector and light intensity.

Similarly, ReflectedLight class and Refracted class are determined.
Fresnel's reflection coeficient and refraction coeficient are multipied
to electrical field vectors respectively in these classes.
